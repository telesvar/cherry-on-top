# Cherry on Top üçíüîù ‚Äì an experimental CPU design inspired by RISC-V and ARM MTE

A very WIP attempt to discover and develop CPUs with inherent memory safety guarantees with a set of architectural extensions that integrate pointer tagging and memory protection.

Goals:
1. Memory protection through boundary checking enabled by tags.
2. Research and develop an efficient implicit memory protection and capabilities model for CPUs.

Non-goals:
1. For now, no type constraints for arithmetic operations.
2. For now, don't consider hardware costs which are considerable
   if implemented naively.  Though, hardware acceleration and
   optimisations are **to be considered**.

How:
1. Pointer integrity:
  * 8-bit tags in upper bits of 64-bit pointers \[8-56].
  * Tags represent capabilities or type information.
2. Memory tagging:
  * One tag per 8-byte aligned memory granule.
  * Tags stored in parallel tag memory structure.
3. Mandatory protection sequence:
  * Alignment ‚Üí permissions ‚Üí W^X ‚Üí tags.
  * Clear fault model.
  * Non-bypassable checks for all memory accesses.

Problems:
1. Tag laundering: memory access checked is bypassed through custom tagging assignment and `TAG_DEFAULT`.  See `test_control_flow_hijack` for details.
2. More to come.
